On my web page it gives instructions on how to interact with the objects. 
To change the colour of a few of the moving objects press the mouse. 
The rest stay the same colour.
Also everytime the page is refreshed the big lined object changes to a different random colour.
This same object follows the mouse from each side of the screen. 
Whilst this is happening the other objects are moving freely.
